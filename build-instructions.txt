# Building MobileDx APK

Here are the steps to build the APK for the MobileDx motorcycle diagnostic application:

## Using Android Studio (Recommended Method)

1. **Open the Project in Android Studio**:
   - Launch Android Studio
   - Select "Open an Existing Project"
   - Navigate to your project directory and select it

2. **Sync the Project with Gradle Files**:
   - Wait for the initial sync process to complete
   - If prompted to upgrade the Gradle version, accept the upgrade

3. **Resolve Dependencies**:
   - Android Studio will automatically download all required dependencies
   - If you encounter any dependency resolution issues, make sure you're connected to the internet

4. **Build the Debug APK**:
   - Select Build > Build Bundle(s) / APK(s) > Build APK(s)
   - Wait for the build process to complete

5. **Find the Generated APK**:
   - Once the build completes, click on the notification "APK(s) generated successfully"
   - Click on "locate" to open the folder containing the APK
   - The debug APK will be located at: app/build/outputs/apk/debug/app-debug.apk

6. **Build the Release APK (Optional)**:
   - For a release build, you'll need to:
     1. Create a keystore file for signing your app
     2. Configure the signing configuration in build.gradle
     3. Select Build > Generate Signed Bundle/APK
     4. Follow the prompts to create and sign your release APK

## Command Line Alternative (For Advanced Users)

If you're comfortable with the command line, you can also build using:

```bash
# For Windows:
.\gradlew.bat assembleDebug

# For Linux/Mac:
./gradlew assembleDebug
```

The generated APK will be located at:
`app/build/outputs/apk/debug/app-debug.apk`

## Installing the APK on Your Device

1. **Enable USB Debugging**:
   - On your Android device, go to Settings > About phone
   - Tap "Build number" 7 times to enable Developer options
   - Go back to Settings > System > Developer options
   - Enable "USB debugging"

2. **Install the APK**:
   - Connect your device to your computer with a USB cable
   - Allow USB debugging when prompted on your device
   - Copy the APK to your device or use adb:
     ```bash
     adb install app/build/outputs/apk/debug/app-debug.apk
     ```
   - Alternatively, you can transfer the APK using file manager and install it directly on the device

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter issues building the APK:

1. **Gradle Build Issues**:
   - Try "File > Invalidate Caches / Restart" in Android Studio
   - Ensure you have the correct JDK installed (JDK 17 is required)
   - Update Android Studio and the Android SDK

2. **Dependency Issues**:
   - Make sure you have internet connectivity
   - Check if any repositories are blocked by your network

3. **Firebase Configuration**:
